# 🖼️ Image to Black & White Converter

A beginner-friendly **Python script** that converts images to either:

- **Grayscale** (shades of gray)  
- **Pure Black & White** (binary mode with adjustable threshold)  

This tool is part of my learning journey in photo editing and script development.  
I also run a site: [**Piksart.one**](https://piksart.one/) where you can explore more about **PicsArt Mod APK** and creative editing tools.

## 🚀 Features

- Switch to **black & white (bw)** mode with `--mode bw`  
- Adjust threshold (0–255) for best results
