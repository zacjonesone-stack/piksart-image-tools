# 🖼️ Image to Black & White Converter

A simple and beginner-friendly **Python script** that converts images into:

- **Grayscale** (shades of gray)  
- **Pure Black & White** (binary mode with adjustable threshold)  

This project is part of my learning journey in photo editing and script development.  
I also run a site: [**PicsArt Mod APK**](https://piksart.one/) where you can explore more about creative editing tools.

## 🚀 Features

- Adjust threshold (0–255) for sharper results
